## Project Overview
**HRMS Lite** is a lightweight Human Resource Management System designed to help small to medium organizations manage employees and attendance efficiently. The application provides:

- Employee creation, listing, and management
- Attendance marking and filtering by employee
- Dashboard statistics showing total employees, present, and absent counts
- Fully responsive frontend built with React and Tailwind CSS
- REST API backend built with Django and Django REST Framework
- Real-time data persistence with deployed backend on Render

The goal of this project is to create a **realistically usable HRMS system**, not just a demo.
